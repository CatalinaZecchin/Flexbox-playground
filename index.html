        <p class="paragraph">You will dine well with me, my Fabullus, in a few days,
            if the gods favor you, if you bring with you a good and large dinner,
            not without a dazzling girl and wine and wit and all your loud laughter.
            If you bring these things, I say, our charming one,
            you will eat well; for the wallet of your Catullus is full of cobwebs.
            But in return, you receive pure loves of anything that is more sweet or
            elegant:
            for I will give you perfume, which the Venuses and Cupids gave to my girl,
            which, when you smell it, you will ask the gods,
            Fabullus, to make all of you a nose.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I hate and love. If you were to ask how

            I got this way, I’d have no answer;

            but since I can recall, I have suffered

            **–I have felt this torment.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">“Si tecum attuleris bonam atque magnam cenam, non sine
            candida puella,” she said.
            “If you bring with you a good meal and lots of it, and not without a pretty
            girl.
            That’s the one. That’s my favorite poem.”
            She felt shy, but warm. There was no weight on her tongue, no pebble in her
            throat. Her soul was outside that door, but she was not anxious. She was not
            counting down the seconds. The shot glass with her life in it was in another
            time,
            another place.
            “Et uino et sale et omnibus cachinnis,” he finished for her. “And wine and
            salt
            and all the laughter.”</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Let us live, my Lesbia, and let us love,
            and let us judge all the rumors of the old men
            to be worth just one penny!
            The suns are able to fall and rise:
            When that brief light has fallen for us,
            we must sleep a never ending night.
            Give me a thousand kisses, then another hundred,
            then another thousand, then a second hundred,
            then yet another thousand more, then another hundred.
            Then, when we have made many thousands,
            we will mix them all up so that we don’t know,
            and so that no one can be jealous of us when he finds out
            how many kisses we have shared.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Sparrow, apple of my girl’s eye,
            Often she plays with you, holds you in her lap,
            Gives you a fingertip when you want it
            And urges you to take passionate bites
            Whenever she wishes, gleaming in desire for me,
            To play with something for pleasure.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">You ask, my Lesbia, how many of your kisses
            are enough and more than enough for me.
            As big a number as the Libyan grains of sand
            that lie at silphium producing Cyrene
            between the oracle of Sultry Jupiter
            and the sacred tomb of old Battus;
            Or as many stars that see the secret love affairs of men,
            when the night is silent.
            So many kisses are enough
            and more than enough for mad Catullus to kiss you,
            these kisses which neither the inquisitive are able to count
            nor an evil tongue bewitch.</p>
